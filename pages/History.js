          The District Grand Lodge of Central South Africa was originally called
          The District Grand Lodge of the Transvaal. <br />
          It was founded in 1896 as the considerable distances and poor
          communications between the various Lodges made it apparent that closer
          and more formal links were required. The obvious route was to form a
          District Grand Lodge and so the necessary steps were taken.
          <br />
          The first District Grand Master was Bro. F. Douglas MacMillan. He was
          installed as District Grand Master in Johannesburg on Friday 27th
          March 1896.In 1946 the Orange Free State was incorporated into the
          District and in 1979 the Northern Cape was also incorporated into the
          District and became the District Grand Lodge of The Transvaal, Orange
          Free State and Northern Cape.

          Once the future price is predicted, they then place trading buy and
          sell orders in actual crypto markets. And since most markets complete
          the limit and other types of orders automatically, these buy and sell
          orders are completed. Hence, they make a profit or loss.
          <br />
          In 2004 it was finally decided that with the transformation which had
          occurred in the Country since the first democratic elections in South
          Africa that the District Grand Lodge should change its name to The
          District Grand Lodge of Central South Africa, so that the name would
          cover all of the regional name changes which had occurred and that
          geographically the name would describe the area which our District
          served.

          Lodges active in the District. The current District Grand Master is
          Bro. Jim Kerr, a Master Mason of Lodge Athol No.1442. He was Appointed
          in Oct 2016 and Installed in February 2017.
